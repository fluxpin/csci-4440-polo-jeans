# Polo Jeans Game Engine

This here's our game engine. Is it not nifty? Worship the game engine.

It works in FireFox and Google Chrome, as long as WebGL is enabled.


## Running

`sudo npm install; cake all; script/testServer`

Navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:8000/test.html>.

## Modifying MyGame

* Keep running the test server.
* Run `script/keepCompiling`.
* Make changes to code, save, and reload the browser window.

For example:

* Open `src/main.coffee` in a text editor and change GAME to 'myGame'.
* Open `src/MyGame/Objects/MyObject` in a text editor.
* This object has already been added to `src/MyGame/GameStates/MyGameState`,
so you can see changes to it immediately.


## Using the Engine

Class and method documentation can be found in `doc/index.html`.
(This is generated by `cake all`.)


## Adding Sprites

Every instance of Sprite gets the same sprite as its class name.
Sprites must be put in `res/textures`.
Be sure to update `index.json` with the sprite.
(If `index.json` is wrongly formatted the game will never load.)
