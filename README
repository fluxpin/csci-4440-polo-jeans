Polo Jeans Game Engine
----
This here's our game engine. Is it not nifty? Worship the game engine.

It works in FireFox and Google Chrome, as long as WebGL is enabled.


How to run the sample
----

Run `script/testServer`.

Navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:8000/test.html>.

How to modify MyGame
----
Keep running the test server.

Run `script/keepCompiling` to build continuously.

Run `cake all` to build once (with linting).


Open `src/main.coffee` in a text editor and change GAME to 'myGame'.

Open `src/MyGame/Objects/MyObject` in a text editor.

This object has already been added to `src/MyGame/GameStates/MyGameState`,
so you can see changes to it immediately.

Using the Engine
----
Class and method documentation can be found in `doc/index.html`.
(This is generated by `cake all`.)

Adding Sprites
----
Every instance of Sprite gets the same sprite as its calss name.
Sprites must be put in `res/textures`.
Be sure to update `index.json` with the sprite.
(If `index.json` is wrongly formatted the game will never load.)
